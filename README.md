# Controlio

Controlio is a simple service which allows you to control your computer via SMS **and voice**. With one simple registration step, you not longer have to be bound to your clunkly machine for on-the-go operations. No more running out of the house, only to remember you forgot to do something on your computer!

## Web Server

This is the web server that acts as the middleman between Twillio and a local Controlio client. For more details about the client, please see the [controlio](https://github.com/Controlio/controlio) repo.
